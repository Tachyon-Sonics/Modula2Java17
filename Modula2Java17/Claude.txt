BITSET handling:
- found a typo
- correctly identified TypeResolver, checked how "PROC" is handled
  - then hard coded "BITSET" string in TypeResolver
  
Inline SET OF
- Different approach, reused logic of inline records
- Strange "_r" suffix filtering, although properly commented

Optimize SET operation (remove copyFrom)
- Ok

Comment handling:
- Unused methods (convertToJavadocComment, shouldBeJavadoc (also not really correct)), getCommentsBefore, getCommentsBetween
- Immutable class not created as record
- Funny: first made a comment with /* */ inside, notice it did not compile, fixed it
- Use hard-coded up to 10 lines before statement to find comment
  - Was first hard-coded to 2, then moved to 10, then hallucinate about an extra comment being "taken". I had to tell him there was no error
- Failed to add new CommentTest to the RootSuite (maybe because by default with gradle all tests are discovered)
- Not handled (most of them understandable):
  - /* and */ inside Modula-2 comment
  - (*** -> create a javadoc comment
  - DEFINITION modules

- Fooled by the CompileHelper that allows ignoring added/removed lines
