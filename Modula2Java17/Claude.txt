Comment handling:
- Unused methods (convertToJavadocComment, shouldBeJavadoc (also not really correct)), getCommentsBefore, getCommentsBetween
- Immutable class not created as record
- Use hard-coded up to 5 lines before statement to find comment
- Failed to add new CommentTest to the RootSuite
- Not handled (most of them understandable):
  - /* and */ inside Modula-2 comment
  - (*** -> create a javadoc comment
  - DEFINITION modules

- Fooled by the CompileHelper that allows ignoring added/removed lines
  -> struggle + wrong conclusion (Schr√∂dinger)
